API Documentation: The RESTful API follows standard HTTP methods and status codes. GET requests retrieve data, POST creates new resources, PUT updates existing resources, and DELETE removes resources.

System Architecture: The microservices architecture consists of loosely coupled services that communicate through well-defined APIs. Each service has its own database and can be deployed independently.

Performance Optimization: Database query optimization involves proper indexing, query plan analysis, and avoiding N+1 problems. Use connection pooling and caching strategies for better performance.

Security Guidelines: Implement authentication using JWT tokens, authorize access based on user roles, and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Deployment Process: Use containerization with Docker for consistent environments. Implement CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, staging deployments, and blue-green production releases.

Monitoring and Logging: Set up comprehensive logging with structured formats. Monitor system metrics, application performance, and business KPIs using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
